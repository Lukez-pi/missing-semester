    "There are signals that we can send to a program, when we want to terminate the execution of a program in the shell, we commonly press `<C-C>`, which sends a `SIGINT` (signal interrupt) command to the shell, and terminates the program, we can also do `<C-\\>` to send a `SIGQUIT` signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shown in the lecture through Python, we can write handlers to respond to these signals, this can come in really handy if we want to want to save the intermediate state of our program instead of terminating the execution of the program right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<C-Z>` is `SIGSTOP`, we can start it by doing `bg %some_num`, where `some_num` is the identifier of the process we want to restart  (can find it through the `jobs` command)\n",

    "\n",
    "`nohup` is a command in Linux that keeps processes running even after exiting the shell or the terminal, it prevents the processes or jobs from receiving the `SIGHUP` signal which is the signal sent to a process upon closing or exiting the terminal. That's why it is recommended to run this command with jobs when working through a remote session. However we can still kill this job by sending in the kill signal: `kill -KILL %identifier`"

Tmux key bindings all have the form `<C-b> x` where that means (1) press Ctrl+b, (2) release Ctrl+b, and then (3) press x. A lot of people remodified the `<C-b>` binding to `<C-a>` instead\n",

    "We might also want to consider backing up our dotfiles so we can always revert back to the older version if something goes wrong, we can do this using Github, but what if we don't want to directly create a Github repository with our home directory (which contains all the dotfiles)? What people commonly do is to create a `dotfiles` directory under the home directory, move all the dotfiles under that directory and then version control the `dotfiles` folder. But because when we're running Vim or bash, these programs will only look under the `~` directory for configurations, we can create a softlink or symlink from our `dotfiles` directory to the `home` directory, by doing for example: `ln -s ~/dotfiles/.bashrc ~/.bashrc`, so then whenever Vim or bash is looking for its configuration file, it will be redirected to the `dotfiles` folder. Any changes we make to the `.bashrc` under the `dotfiles` directory will be automatically reflected when we restart `bash` again."
